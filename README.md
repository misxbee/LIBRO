With millions of books accessible in the globe, it might be difficult for people to choose the correct one on their own. Some may turn to impartial ratings or exaggerated descriptions that have the potential to mislead customers and produce incorrect suggestions. This paper introduces LIBRO (Literary Intelligence for Book Recommendation & Organization) that seamlessly integrates collaborative-filtering and content-based filtering techniques to address this issue. Imagine LIBRO as a robotic companion that has access to recommendation algorithms and can deliver tailored book recommendations based on analysis of user preferences and reader commonalities. The significance of LIBRO lies in its ability to provide collaborative filtering techniques and user similarity scores by giving tailored book recommendations along with content-based filtering to provide a variety of specific book recommendations based on readers' past history and preferred genres. Despite its simplicity, the concept of LIBRO represents fundamental aspects of machine learning based recommendation system. By emulating the intuitive recommendations made by librarian in library, hosts in retail stores or waiters in restaurant, LIBRO showcases how AI can effectively replace human interactions in the real world, providing users with insightful recommendations without the need for human intervention. LIBRO enriches the reading experience and empowers users to discover new books that align with their taste in literature and nurture the love for reading.
